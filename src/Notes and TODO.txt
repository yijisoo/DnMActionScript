Assumptions:
- I know where the data type information is in the data schema
- Data must either be Nominal, ordinal, interval
- Primary key is often assumed to be 0

Data Problems:
- Serving size data needs to be converted to same unit

TODO:
[ ] Refactor code to make component a drag-and-drop flex component

[ ] Restructure data structure
[ ] DataStatistics for ordinal data / Remove dataStatisticsObject (Doesn't contain correct statistics for ordinal data)
**Classes SizeTab, ColorTab, MagnetTab

[ ] Fix more efficient version of updateDistMatrix()
[ ] Better sizeCoder Slider (better tick placement)
[ ] Display a warning when encoding on an attribute where every tuple has the same value

[ ] If the data is changeable (i.e. through a "load" feature), code must be added to listen for this change

[ ] Add "about" feature
[ ] Add "Powered by HiveLab"

[ ] Make proper interfacting functions for use by DetailPanel.as
  [ ] A listener is needed for a particle clicked event (do not listen to the dust particles)
  
[ ] Make proper interfacting functions for use by MagnetTab.as

Bugs:
[ ] Primary key assumptions 
  [ ] Primary key index should be made functional (DataManager.as)
  [ ] Change method for finding primary key (DataManager.as)
  [ ] Look at the assumptions listed at the top of each file
